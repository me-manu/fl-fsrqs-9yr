\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

More than half of the sources observed with the \Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) above 100\,MeV are active galaxies that produce particle outflows (jets) at almost the speed of light, which are closely aligned to the line of sight.\footnote{See e.g. \url{http://www.asdc.asi.it/fermi3fgl/}}
%Yet, the exact mechanism and location of \gray production inside such jets of these so-called blazars remain a controversially discussed topic in the literature~\cite{Madejski:2016oqg}.
The broadband electromagnetic radiation observed from these so-called blazars spans decades in energy from radio frequencies up to very-high energy \gray energies. 
It is often described with purely leptonic or a mixture of leptonic and hadronic emission models, involving both intrinsic and external radiation fields~\cite[e.g.,][and references therein]{Madejski:2016oqg}.
%It is often explained with either purely leptonic or mixture of hadronic and leptonic emission models. 
%In leptonic models, the low energy part of the spectral energy distribution (SED) is caused by synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons in magnetic fields, whereas the high energy end of the SED is attributed to inverse Compton scattering of electrons with either the synchrotron emission or external radiation fields. 
%In leptonhadronic models, the high energy emission can be due to proton-synchrotron radiation, or the creation of particle cascades produced in interactions of cosmic rays with ambient gas and radiation fields. 
%In leptonic models, the emission is due to synchrotron emission and inverse Compton scattering of the electrons with synchrotron emission or external radiation fields. In leptohadronic models the high energy emission can be either due to proton-synchrotron radiation or emission produced in particle cascades, which are initiated by cosmic-ray interactions with gas and radiation fields.
A common assumption is that the radiation is emitted by freshly accelerated   particles localized in ``plasmoids''  that move down the jet at relativistic speeds,
 leading to a strong doppler boost of the observed emission. 
Yet, the origin and location of such plasmoids remain unknown. 

Blazars also display variable emission at all observationally accessible time scales, limited only by signal-to-noise.
Surprisingly, at \gray energies, flux doubling times as low as minutes have been observed both in BL Lac-type objects and flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) with ground-based Cherenkov telescopes and the \FermiLAT~\cite[e.g.][]{pks2155hess2007,pks1222magic2011,TheFermi-LAT:2016dss}.
In these cases, causality arguments suggest extremely compact emission regions realized in, e.g., magnetic reconnection events or recollimation shocks~\cite[e.g.][]{Petropoulou:2016xat,Bodo:2017qqn}.
In particular for FSRQs, the observation of \Grays beyond 10\,GeV suggests that these compact dissipation sites are located at distances of hundreds of Schwarzschild  radii from the central super massive black hole. 
Otherwise, the \gray emission would be strongly attenuated in the interaction with UV and optical photons that are emitted from fast rotating clouds of ionized gas of the broad line region (BLR). 
Meeting these constraints is challenging for standard emission scenarios as extreme relativistic bulk motions of the plasma have to be invoked~\cite[e.g.,][]{TheFermi-LAT:2016dss}. 

After almost one decade of continuous all-sky observations, the \FermiLAT has accumulated a large sample of flares from many FSRQs.
Our goal is to characterize the flares and long-term behaviour of the FSRQs that have shown the brightest \gray flares over the course of the \Fermi mission. 
The brightest flares enable us to perform a comprehensive search for \gray variability on time scales as short as minutes in order to investigate if such short variability -- and conversely compact emission sites -- is a common phenomenon 
in FSRQ flares. 
Such short variability has already been discovered in 3C\,279~\citep{TheFermi-LAT:2016dss} and recently in CTA\,102~\citep{2018ApJ...854L..26S}, but searches in other sources have been unsuccessfull~\citep{2017Galax...5..100N}.
The plethora of observed flares also allows us to perform a systematic study of the local temporal flare profiles, which could be connected to particle injection or particle propagation.
\citet{2013MNRAS.430.1324N} investigated the brightest \gray flares blazar in the first 4 years of LAT data.
The author found that, on average, flares have a slight tendency towards rise times being shorter than decay times, however, no flare showed extreme asymmetry. 
\citet{2010ApJ...722..520A} characterized the blazars in terms of their power spectral density (PSD) using 11 months of data and found that bright blazars mostly fall in an intermittent regime between red noise (flickering) and Brownian noise. 
These analyses can be significantly extended with almost one decade of continuous \fermiLAT observations.


Additionally, the high signal-to-noise spectra during flaring states enable the search for spectral absorption features due to the interaction of \Grays with BLR photons.
The detection of such features would locate the \gray emission region inside the BLR with important implications where particles dissipate their energy. 
Indeed, evidence for such absorption was reported in early  \fermiLAT observations~\citep{2010ApJ...717L.118P}, but a recent analysis of a large sample of 100 FSRQs and over 7\,years of observations could not confirm this result~\citep{2018MNRAS.477.4749C}.
The absence of the absorption features can in turn be used to derive lower limits on the distance of the \gray emitting region to the central super-massive black hole. 

The article is organized as follows. 
In Sec.~\ref{sec:data} we present the source selection and \FermiLAT data analysis. 
We investigate the source behaviour on different time scales in Sec.~\ref{}, starting from light curves over the whole mission lifetime on consecutively zooming-in on \gray flares which we investigate on shorter time scales. 
For the first time, we use an unbiased method based on Bayesian blocks (BBs)~\citep{2013ApJ...764..167S} and one-dimensional group finding algorithms based on~\citet{1998ApJ...498..137E} to identify flares on shorter and shorter timescales.  
We discuss our findings in Sec.~\ref{}
before concluding in Sec.~\ref{}.

\section{Source selection and data analysis}
\label{sec:data}

We search for the brightest \gray flares among the sources included in the monitored source list\footnote{\url{https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/}}. 
Selecting blazars that have shown average daily fluxes $F \geqslant 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ within ($1\,\sigma$ statistical uncertainties) above 100\,MeV,
we are left with a selection of 6 FSRQs, listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:src-select}, together with their coordinates, redshift, as well as black hole mass and luminosity of the $\mathrm{H}\beta$ line taken from the literature~\citep{2006ApJ...637..669L,2012RMxAA..48....9T}.  
The black hole mass and $\mathrm{H}\beta$ luminosity will be used in Sec.~\ref{} to model the optical line emission from the BLR.
With the chosen flux threshold we ensure that we have at least one flare of each source in the sample that is suitable to search for intra-orbit variability and to derive high signal-to-noise spectra. 
All of the selected FSRQs are well known \gray emitters and individual flares from these objects have been studied in great detail~\citep[e.g.,][]{}. 
As noted in the Introduction, two of the sources (3C\,279, CTA\,102) have already been shown to be variable on extremely short timescales~\citep{TheFermi-LAT:2016dss,2018ApJ...854L..26S}. 
Furthermore, PKS\,B1222+216, 3C\,279, and PKS\,1510-089  are among the 7 FSRQs also detected above 100\,GeV with imaging air Cherenkov Telescopes~\citep{}.

\subsection{Data selection}

Our goal is characterize both the long term \gray behaviour of the selected FSRQs as well as the brightest flares.
We therefore select \Grays that have been measured with the \FermiLAT between August 4, 2008, and January 30, 2018, yielding a total data set of almost 9.5\,years or 114\,months.
The \FermiLAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to measure \Grays with energies between 20\,MeV to above 300\,GeV~\citep{2009ApJ...697.1071A} and we 
 use \Grays within the energy range of 100\,MeV and 316\,GeV. 
Below 100\,MeV the effective area of the LAT quickly decreases and the point spread function increases to above $\sim 6^\circ$\footnote{See, e.g., \url{http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/glast/groups/canda/lat_Performance.htm}} making a point source analysis challenging. 
Since FSRQs usually have curved \gray spectra, we do not expect significant detection of these sources above our chosen maximum energy.
To mitigate contamination of \Grays of the Earth Limb, we limit the sample to events that have arrived at a zenith angle less than $90^\circ$ and we excise periods of bright GRBs and solar flares that have been detected with a test statistic $\mathrm{TS} > 100$.
The test statisitic is defined as $\mathrm{TS} = -2\ln(\mathcal{L}_1 / \mathcal{L}_0)$, i.e., the log-likelihood ratio between the the maximized likelihoods $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_0$ for the hypotheses with and without an additional source, respectively~\citep{mattox1996}.
We use the latest \texttt{Pass 8} instrumental response functions and Monte Carlo simulations~\citep{pass8} and select \gray events that pass the \texttt{P8R2 SOURCE} event selection. 
For each source we analyze $10^\circ \times 10^\circ$ regions of interest (ROIs) centered on the position of each source as provided in the third \fermiLAT point source catalog \citep[3FGL,][]{3fgl}.
We choose a spatial binning of $0.1^\circ$ per pixel and 8 energy bins per decade. 

\subsection{ROI optimization}
\label{sec:roi}

Our analysis proceeds iteratively, starting from the full time range and zooming in on bright flares and shorter time scales (see Sec.~\ref{sec:zoom}).
In a first step, we optimize the global \gray model of each ROI using the \textit{Fermi Science Tools} version 11-05-03\footnote{\url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software}} and \textsc{fermipy}, version 0.16.0+188\footnote{\url{http://fermipy.readthedocs.io}}~\citep{fermipy}.
The initial model consists of all \gray point sources within $15^\circ$ from the ROI center included in the 3FGL as well as the standard templates for isotropic and Galactic diffuse emission.\footnote{For the Galactic diffuse emission we use the file gll\_iem\_v06.fits and the file iso\_P8R2\_SOURCE\_V6\_v06.txt for the isotropic diffuse component, see: \url{ http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/BackgroundModels.html}}
After an initial optimization, we free the spectral normalization of sources that are within $10^\circ$ from the ROI center or that are detected with $\mathrm{TS} > 50$.
The spectral shape parameters such as power-law indices, curvature, or cut-off energies are free to vary for sources within $5^\circ$ from the ROI center. 
We freeze all spectral source parameters for sources detected with $\mathrm{TS} < 1$ or if the number of predicted photons is less than $10^{-3}$.
The normalizations of the diffuse backgrounds are also left free during the fit, together with the spectral index of the Galactic diffuse background template.
After the fit has converged successfully, 
we relocalize the central \gray source and re-fit all spectral model parameters. The relocalized source positions are provided in Table~\ref{tab:src-select}.
After this step, we generate a $\mathrm{TS}$ map to search for additional point sources. For each pixel in the ROI, we add a putative point source with a power-law spectrum with index $\Gamma = 2$ and calculate its $\mathrm{TS}$. If  $\sqrt{\mathrm{TS}} \geqslant 5$, we permanently add the source at the position of the highest $\mathrm{TS}$ value and re-optimize the spectral parameters for the whole ROI. This step is repeated until no further sources are found.

With the best-fit model for each ROI, we compute the \gray light curves for the FSRQs with an initial binning of 7~days. 
In each light curve bin, we leave spectral parameters free during the fit for sources within $3^\circ$ from the ROI center and additionally the normalizations of the Galactic and isotropic emission. If any of these sources have $\mathrm{TS} < 1$ or the number of predicted photons is less than $10^{-3}$, all parameters are fixed to their average values.

\subsection{Zooming in on bright flares using an unbiased method to identify different activity states}
\label{sec:zoom}

The 9.5 year light curves for all considered FSRQs are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:weekly}. If the source is detected with $\mathrm{TS} < 9$ within one time bin or the flux in one bin is equal or smaller than its statistical uncertainty $F_i \leqslant \sigma_i$, we show upper limits at the $2\,\sigma$ confidence level instead (open symbols). The average source fluxes with their 1$\,\sigma$ statistical uncertainties, $\overline{F} \pm \sigma_{\overline{F}}$, derived from the likelihood maximazation of the full time range are shown as gray bands. 
The flux measurements and uncertainties are used to derive BB representations of the light curves with the \textit{point measurement} algorithm of~\citet[][]{2013ApJ...764..167S}, which are shown as orange lines. 
The BBs provide an unbiased way to detect significant local variations in the light curve.
Several strong flares exceeding the average flux level are easily identified from the BBs. 

%%% Full light curve %%%

    \caption{\gray light curves with weekly binning for the considered FSRQs. Open symbols denote upper limits at the $2\,\sigma$ confidence level. The orange lines show the BBs and the shaded regions represent the identified HOP groups. The green shaded regions denote the time itnervals identified as large flares for which the zoomed-in analysis is performed.}
    \label{fig:weekly}
\end{figure*}

There is no generally accepted consensus to determine the data points that belong to a flaring state and which characterize the quiescent level. \citet{2013MNRAS.430.1324N} suggests a simple definition that a flare is a continuous time interval associated with a flux peak in which the flux is larger than half the peak flux value. 
This definition is intuitive, however, it is unclear how to treat overlapping flares and identify flux peaks in an unbiased way. To mitigate these problems, we have implemented one dimensional implementation of the HOP algorithm~\citep{1998ApJ...498..137E}.
The algorithm associates data points to their nearest neighbor weighted by flux.
We feed the BB representation of the light curve to the HOP algorithm and the resulting groups of data points are shown 
Fig.~\ref{fig:weekly} as left and right hatched areas. \todo{some more details}
The combination of BBs and the HOP algorithm represents an unbiased way to split a light curve into groups of quiescent and flaring episodes; we will refer to one connected flare episode as a \emph{HOP group} of consecutive BBs.

We iteratively zoom in on time ranges with bright \gray activity by identifying HOP groups where one BB fulfills the condition $F_{BB} \geqslant F_\mathrm{max} =  5\times\overline{F}$ and including adjacent blocks with $F_{BB} \geqslant F_\mathrm{min} = \overline{F}$. We prefer this minimum flux criterion over including the full HOP group as it might extend over long time ranges of a quiescent state.
Overlapping time ranges are combined into one time range and the ranges are extended by one time bin on each side. Each time range is extended by one time bin on either side.
For the identified time span, we re-optimize the spectral model of the ROI in the same way as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:roi} but without re-localizing the central FSRQ or adding new point sources. Subsequently, we calculate a light curve with finer binning and again select the time ranges of the highest \gray activity. We repeat this procedure twice, down to a binning equal to the Good Time Intervals (GTIs), of the \Fermi satellite, which correspond to one passage of the source through the field of view of the satellite during one $\sim$ 95 minute orbit.
The choices of time binnings and values for $F_\mathrm{max}$ and $F_\mathrm{min}$ are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:zoom} together with the number of identified high \gray activity states (which might consists of several flares as indicated by the HOP groups).
The values of the threshold fluxes $F_\mathrm{max}, F_\mathrm{min}$ is somewhat arbitrary and are a compromise between including as many flares as possible but keeping the overall number of flares manageable. Note, that the sole purpose of this exercise is to select the brightest flares for  further analysis. 
The resulting time ranges for the weekly light curves are plotted as green shaded areas in Fig.~\ref{fig:weekly}.
The intermittent daily light curves are provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:daily} and  Fig.~\ref{fig:gti} shows the GTI light curves. 
The source exposure can vary significantly between two adjacent orbits, as the satellite rocks between the celestial north and south pole in between orbits. This explains the large error bars on some of the time bins of the GTI light curves.

In a last step, we derive light curves on sub-GTI time scales. 
The time bin size is calculated from the adaptive binning method of \citet{lott2012}, where we choose bins of constant flux uncertainty of $\sim20\,\%$. 
In this step, we use the space craft information in time steps of 1\,s instead of 30\,s. Additionally, we compute the effective area in 5 bins of the azimuthal spacecraft coordinates since on such short time scales the exposure dependence on the azimuth cannot be averaged over.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We first present results derived from the weekly \gray light curves spanning the full 9.5\,year time range, which we refer to \emph{global light curve properties}, before deriving results from the local light curves on GTI and sub-GTI time scales.

\subsection{Global \gray light curve properties}
From the weekly light curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:weekly} it is evident that the FSRQs show strong flares that exceed the average flux by a factor of a few, while the quiescent level is relatively stable. 
Such behavior is typical for FSRQs~\citet{} and we 
further quantify it by calculating the flux distribution, $dN/dF$, of the weekly fluxes for bins with $\mathrm{TS} > 9$ and $F_i > \sigma_i$. 
The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fluxpdf}. The flux bins are chosen according to the algorithm of~\citet{knuth2006} and the error bars are calculated under the assumption that the observed weekly fluxes, $F_i$, $i = 1,\ldots,N$, are Gaussian distributed numbers with standard deviation equal to the measurement uncertainty $\sigma_i$.\footnote{
With this assumption, the uncertainty to find $x$ entries in the $j$-th flux bin of width $\Delta F_j = F_{\mathrm{hi},j} - F_{\mathrm{lo},j}$ is given by the sum of Bernoulli probabilities $p_{ij}$, $\sum_{i = 1}^N p_{ij}(1-p_{ij})$, where $p_{ij} =  \left[\mathrm{erf}\left((F_{\mathrm{hi},j} - F_i) / \sqrt{2\sigma_i^2}\right) - \mathrm{erf}\left(((F_{\mathrm{lo},j} - F_i) / \sqrt{2\sigma_i^2}\right)\right]/2$, and $\mathrm{erf}$ is the error function.
}
We fit the flux distribution with a smoothly broken power law (BPL) of the form 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN}{dF} = N_0 \left( \frac{F}{F_0}\right)^{\alpha_\mathrm{low}}
        \left( 1 - \left(\frac{F}{F_\mathrm{br}}\right)^s \right)^{\frac{\alpha_\mathrm{high} - \alpha_\mathrm{low}}{s}},
        \label{eq:dndf}
\end{equation}
with the smoothing factor $s$ fixed to 3. 
The results of a $\chi^2$ minimazation are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:global}.
Generally, below the break flux $F_\mathrm{br}$, the flux distribution is flat, $\alpha_\mathrm{low}\sim 0$.
Above $F_\mathrm{br}$ which lies between $\sim2\times10^{-7}$ and $\sim2\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $dN/dF$ declines exponentially with power-law indices $\alpha_\mathrm{high} \lesssim -2.2$, making the brightest flares rare events.
Furthermore, it is clear that the flux distribution is very different from Gaussian behavior.

    \includegraphics[width = .99\linewidth]{figures/fluxdist_weekly_tsmin9.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:fluxpdf} Distribution of the fluxes of the weekly 9.5 year \gray light curves. The BPL fit is shown as a black line with $1\,\sigma$ uncertainties shown as shaded bands.}
\end{figure}

We further characterize the global \gray light curves in terms of their PSD,
which usually can be described with simple power laws in frequency,  $\mathrm{PSD} \propto 1 / \nu^\beta$~\citep{}.
An analysis of the first 11~months of LAT data from 106 blazars revealed that 
these objects have $\beta$ values between 1 and 2, the intermittent regime between flicker noise ($\beta = 1$) and Brownian motion ($\beta = 2)$~\citep{2010ApJ...722..520A}. 
In addition to the noise behavior, 
we further use the derived PSDs in Sec.~\ref{} to simulate \gray light curves in order to calculate the significance of a correlation between radio and \gray emission. 

The best-fit PSDs are estimated from the periodograms and simulated light curves following the method described in detail in \citet{2014MNRAS.445..437M} and \citet{2013MNRAS.433..907E} and summarized briefly below.
The observed periodograms $P(\nu)$ as a function of frequency $\nu$ are calculated from the absolute square of the Fourier transformation of the light curve (Eq.~(3) of \citealt{2014MNRAS.445..437M}) including all 
data points detected with $\mathrm{TS} \geqslant 9$ and performing a linear interpolation between gaps in the light curve. Since we are using weekly binned light curves and bright FSRQs the gaps are small and at most 6 consecutive data points long (42\,days) in the case of PKS\,B1222+216. The number of non-detected bins is less than $\sim13\,\%$ for all sources.
The interpolation is done in time steps of $\Delta t=0.7\,$days and 
 re-binned into bins of lengths of 7 days by taking the geometrical mean of the flux.
In contrast to~\citet{2014MNRAS.445..437M}, we do not apply a window function (see the discussion below). 

We simulate light curves using the method of \citet{1995A&A...300..707T} with a time steps equal to 0.7\,days for power-law PSDs with values $0 \leqslant \beta \leqslant 3$ in steps of $\Delta\beta = 0.05$. For each $\beta$ value 100 light curves are generated, each one a 100 times longer than the actual observation to account for possible red-noise leakage. Splitting the simulated light curves (without overlap) leaves us with $10^4$ realizations. 
The light curves are then re-binned into 7-day light curves through averaging. The same observational gaps and interpolation as in the observed light curves are applied. 
The periodograms are then calculated for light curve in the same way for the observed light curve.
To fix the normalization of the PSD model, \citet{2014MNRAS.445..437M} suggest variance matching, i.e., they rescale the simulated flux data points with a factor $A^{-1}$, where $A^2 = \sigma_\mathrm{sim}^2 / (\sigma_\mathrm{obs}^2 - \bar{\sigma_i^2})$, with $\sigma_\mathrm{sim}^2$ ($\sigma_\mathrm{data}^2$) the variance of the simulated (observed) light curve and $\bar{\sigma_i^2}$ the variance of the observational noise.
For the \gray light curves, we choose to follow \citet{2013MNRAS.433..907E} instead and iteratively match the probability distribution of the simulated fluxes to the observed ones, given by the $dN/dF$ distrutions shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fluxpdf}. 
The reason is that the algorithm of \citet{1995A&A...300..707T} produces light curves with Gaussian distributed fluxes, which is clearly not the case at \gray energies.\footnote{Furthermore, the variance matching relies on Parseval's theorem from which it follows that the light curve variance is equal to the integrated PSD. However, Parseval's theorem is only valid for square-integrable functions, i.e. $\beta \geqslant 2$ and thus not strictly applicable for smaller values of $\beta$ commonly observed at \gray energies.}
In a final step, we add uncertainties to the light curves by randomly drawing with replacement from the observed uncertainties $\sigma_i$ and adding a Gaussian random number $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_i)$ to the simulated flux values.

The peridograms of the observed and simulated light curves, ${P}_\mathrm{obs}$ and ${P}_\mathrm{sim}$, are averaged in logarithmic bins~\citep{1993MNRAS.261..612P} and compared by means of a $\chi^2$ test~\citep{2014MNRAS.445..437M},
\begin{equation}
    \chi^2(\beta) = \sum_{\nu_\mathrm{min}}^{\nu_\mathrm{max}}\frac{(P_\mathrm{obs}(\nu) - \overline{P}_\mathrm{sim}(\nu,\beta))^2}{\Delta\overline{P}_\mathrm{sim}(\nu,\beta)^2},\label{eq:chi2psd}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\overline{P}_\mathrm{sim}(\nu)^2$ is the variance of the simulated light curves.
The averaged periodograms of the simulated light curves and the observed ones are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:periodograms} and the best fit average periodogram is shown as a thick solid line. 
The quality of the the best-fit value $\hat\beta$ with corresponding minimum $\chi^2$ value $\hat\chi^2\equiv\chi^2(\hat\beta)$, is evaluated from the light curves simulated with $\beta = \hat\beta$ in the following way. We form the distributions of simulated $\chi^2$ values, $\chi^2_\mathrm{sim}$, by replacing $P_\mathrm{obs}(\nu)$ with $P_\mathrm{sim}(\nu,\beta)$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:chi2psd}),
\begin{equation}
    \chi^2_\mathrm{sim}(\beta,\beta') = \sum_{\nu_\mathrm{min}}^{\nu_\mathrm{max}}\frac{(P_\mathrm{sim}(\nu,\beta) - \overline{P}_\mathrm{sim}(\nu,\beta'))^2}{\Delta\overline{P}_\mathrm{sim}(\nu,\beta')^2},\label{eq:chi2psd_sim}
\end{equation}
and calculate the $p$-value as the  fraction of simulations that result in $\chi^2_\mathrm{sim}(\hat\beta,\hat\beta) > \hat\chi^2$.
The confidence interval for $\hat\beta$ is derived by determining the $\Delta\chi^2_\mathrm{sim}(\hat{\beta},\beta)$ value from simulations such that 95\,\% of the time the simulated (true) $\beta$ value is contained within $\Delta\chi^2$. 
The same $\Delta\chi^2$ value is then applied to the observed $\chi^2$ curve.
The results of our PSD analysis are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:global} where we also report the value of $\beta$ obtained from a linear regression in log-log space. 
In general, the periodograms are well fit by our method, as indicated by the $p$-values and observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:periodograms}. 
The only exception is 3C\,279 where only 2 of the $10^4$ simulated light curves result in a $\chi^2_\mathrm{sim}(\hat\beta,\hat\beta) > \hat\chi^2$.
The steep $\chi^2$ curve for this source also explains the small error bars on the reconstructed value of $\beta$.
The reason might be a more complex underlying PSD or the specific 7 day binning we have chosen here.

\subsection{Local light curve properties}
\label{sec:hop-fit}

We derive local properties of the \gray flares from the light curves with one bin per GTI that are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gti}.
To this end, 
we fit each HOP group $i$ with a $\chi^2$ minimization as a sum of exponential profiles, 
\begin{eqnarray}
    F_{\mathrm{flare},i}(t) &=& 
    \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{N_i} F_{0,ij}\nonumber\\
    &\times&\left[\exp\left(\frac{t - t_{0,ij}}{\tau_{\mathrm{rise},ij}}\right) + \exp
    \left(\frac{t_{0,ij} - t}{\tau_{\mathrm{decay},ij}}\right)\right]^{-1}\!\!\!,&
    \label{eq:flareHOP}
\end{eqnarray}
where $t_{0,j}$ are the flare peak times, and $\tau_{\mathrm{rise},ij}$, $\tau_{\mathrm{decay},ij}$ are the flare rise and decay times, respectively.
All light curve points are included that fulfill $\mathrm{TS}\geqslant9$ and $F_i \geqslant 3\sigma_i/2 $.
The number of flare profiles per HOP shed, $N_i$, is either 1 or 2 and determined during the fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), defined as $\mathrm{BIC} = n_\mathrm{par}\ln(n) + \chi^2$, where $n_\mathrm{par}$ is the number of fit paramteres ($n_\mathrm{par} = 4$ for $N_i = 1$), $n$ is the number of data points within one HOP group $i$. Two flare profiles are selected if the difference between the two BIC values is $\Delta\mathrm{BIC} = \mathrm{BIC}(N_i = 2) - \mathrm{BIC}(N_i = 1) < 0$.
The reason for allowing $N_i > 1$ is that the flare profile in Eq.~(\ref{eq:flareHOP}) does not capture long-lasting plateaus of a flare present in multiple flares in Fig.~\ref{fig:gti} (see, e.g., all flares of 3C\,279 or the panel with a flare of 3C\,454.3 starting at 55551.65\,MJD).

After each HOP group is fitted individually and $N_i$ is determined, 
we re-fit the entire light curve, which consists of $N_\mathrm{HOP}$ groups, with the function 
\begin{equation}
    F_\mathrm{flare}(t) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N_\mathrm{HOP}}F_{\mathrm{flare},i}(t) + F_\mathrm{bkg}(t),
\end{equation}
where $F_\mathrm{bkg}(t)$ is a order-2 polynomial to describe a slow  varying background.
The fit results are shown as black solid lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:gti}.
In general, the $\chi^2$ values divided by the degrees of freedom (dof) are between 1 and 2 (see the legends in Fig.~\ref{fig:gti}). Given the large values of dof, the fit qualities are usually poor. This is not unexpected, as we only allow up to two flare profiles per HOP group and not arbitrary functions. Already with this choice, there are probably some spurious flares identified, see, e.g., the second flare profile in the first PKS\,1510-089 flare (starting at 54908.65MJD). 
Nevertheless, the overall light curve evolution is well captured, which allows us to describe the local flare properties from the ensembles of flare profiles, keeping the above caveats in mind. 

We show the distribution of rise and decay times in the histograms of Fig.~\ref{fig:times-hist} for flares with a time integrated flux $>10^{-7}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. 
Remarkably, all sources show values of either $\tau_\mathrm{rise}$ or $\tau_\mathrm{decay}$ or both that are below the horizon crossing time scale of the central super massive black hole in the observer's frame, $t_g = r_g / c$, with $r_g = 2 G M_\bullet / c^2 $ the gravitational radius, $G$ the gravitational constant, black hole mass $M_\bullet$ (taken from Tab.~\ref{tab:src-select}), and $c$ the speed of light.
Most flares rise and decay within 2 hours or less. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .8\linewidth]{figures/lcfithop_results_tdtrhist_maxiter2_fsys0p00_addcomp0_orbit.pdf}
    \caption{Stacked bar graphs for  rise (top) and decay times (bottom) for the individual flares fitted in Fig.~\ref{fig:gti}. The legend gives the horizon crossing time scales $t_g$ in the observer's frame.}
    \label{fig:times-hist}
\end{figure}

From the rise and decay times, we can calculate the flare asymmetry as
\begin{equation}
    A = \frac{\tau_\mathrm{rise}-\tau_\mathrm{decay}}
    {\tau_\mathrm{rise}+\tau_\mathrm{decay}},
\end{equation}
so that $A < 0$ for fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) type flares, as expected from an injection of energetic particles that subsequently cool through radiative processes such as inverse Compton scattering or synchrotron emission.
The asymmtry is shown versus integrated flux, the peak flux, and the flare duration $T_{90}$, defined in the time around the flare peak that contains 90\,\% of the integrated flux, in Fig.~\ref{fig:asym}.
The peak flux for each flare of each HOP group is derived from the maximum of  Eq.~(\ref{eq:flareHOP}) with respect to time (suppressing indeces),
\begin{equation}
    F_{\mathrm{peak}} = \frac{F_{0} \tau_\mathrm{rise}}{\tau_\mathrm{rise} + \tau_\mathrm{decay}}\exp\left(\ln\left(\frac{\tau_\mathrm{decay}}{\tau_\mathrm{rise}}\right)\frac{\tau_\mathrm{decay}}{\tau_\mathrm{rise} + \tau_\mathrm{decay}}\right)
\end{equation}
The error bars on the peak flux and asymmetry are derived from standard Gaussian error propagation from the fit uncertainties.
\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .8\linewidth]{figures/lcfithop_results_asym_vs_all_orbit_maxiter2_fsys0p00_addcomp0.pdf}
    \caption{Flare asymmetry versus integrated flux (left), peak flux (center), and flare duration $T_{90}$ (right) for the fitted flare profiles shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gti}.}
    \label{fig:asym}
\end{figure*}

The median of the asymmetry is found to be $-0.195$, i.e., FRED-type flares are more common than the opposite. In general, the flares show a versatile behaviour and clear trends are seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:asym}. This is also reflected in the fact that we do not find any significant correlation between the asymmetry and the other quantities using Kendall's $\tau$.
The most significant correlation we find is between $F_\mathrm{peak}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{decay}$ with Kendall's $\tau = -0.263$ and a $p$-value of $0.005\,(2.6\,\sigma)$ suggesting that flares with higher peak fluxes have shorter decay times. However, with the number of tested correlations (seven) the significance is too low to draw any firm conclusions (post-trial significance is 0.03 or $1.8\,\sigma$). 

We also investigate whether subsequent flares in each panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:gti} show a trend with time in integrated flux, peak flux, or duration. 
For consecutive flares, we calculate the difference between, e.g., the peak fluxes, and calculate the $p$-value of a Binomial distribution of finding the observed number positive values of the differences for a probability of 50\,\% of finding either positive or negative values, which constitutes the random case.
For 32 values of differences the $p$-values for the integrated and peak flux, as well as for the flare duration are close to 0.1 (14, 13, and 13 positive values for 32 trials, respectively) indicating no particular evolution of these quantities with time.

\todo{
Things done differently with respect to Fermi periodograms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used variance matching instead of EM13 algorithm as it did not reprocude the observed periodograms, however the variance matching did. Also, PSDs generally closer or above two, Parseval's theorem applies
    \item no uncertainties of light curve applied, generally led to a strong flattening of simulated PSDs for high beta values, not observed in observed PSD. Selection of errors not perfect / too high, that's why white noise at high frequencies, also correlation between errors and fluxes observed, not taken into account when drawing randomly
    \item Radio light curves show large gaps, light curve is split when gap is larger than 20 times the median gap between observations. Compromise between too many splits and too short individual light curves and interpolating over too large gaps. Interpolation step chosen to be 80\,\% quantile of the gaps in the split light curves, again as compromise between inventing data points and being able to sample a broad frequency range
    \item individual light curves log averaged follwing the 1993 paper.
